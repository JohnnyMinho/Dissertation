	abstract = {Deep learning-based object detection is one of the most popular research topics. However, in cases where large-scale datasets are unavailable, the training of detection models remains challenging due to the data-driven characteristics of deep learning. Small object detection in infrared images is such a case. To solve this problem, we propose a YOLOv5-based framework with a novel training strategy based on the domain adaptation method. First, an auxiliary domain classiﬁer is combined with the YOLOv5 architecture to compose a detection framework that is trainable using datasets from multiple domains while maintaining calculation costs in the inference stage. Secondly, a new loss function based on Wasserstein distance is proposed to deal with small-sized objects by overcoming the problem of the intersection over union sensitivity problem in small-scale cases. Then, a model training strategy inspired from domain adaptation and knowledge distillation is presented. Using the domain conﬁdence output of the domain classiﬁer as a soft label, domain confusion loss is backpropagated to force the model to extract domain-invariant features while training the model with datasets with imbalanced distributions. Additionally, we generate a synthetic dataset in both the visible light and infrared spectrum to overcome the data shortage. The proposed framework is trained on the MS COCO, VEDAI, DOTA, ADAS Thermal datasets along with a constructed synthetic dataset for human detection and vehicle detection tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed framework achieved the best mean average precision (mAP) of 64.7 and 57.5 in human and vehicle detection tasks. Additionally, the ablation experiment shows that the proposed training strategy can improve the performance by training the model to extract domain-invariant features.},

	abstract = {A Vehicular Adhoc Network (VANET) is a conceptualisation that can be applied to the communications domain of an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), where vehicles use On Board Units (OBU) to communicate with other vehicles or the road side infrastructure. The heterogeneity of the interconnected devices, the large number of devices inside and outside the vehicles and different degrees of device density, makes interoperability a challenging problem, making way to many machine-2-machine (M2M) autonomous communications. This paper discusses two different M2M architectures that may be used in ITS context and presents test results obtained from implementations of these M2M architectures on real OBU hardware, in the context of ETSI compliant safety applications. The experimental results were taken using two different oneM2M Vehicular Architectures Types in order to analyse their suitability to be used in a platooning car-following use case. For the car-following use case, OBUs interface the vehicle’s Controller Area Network (CAN) bus and use Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) for M2M communications to convey dynamic data to enable controlling the vehicle’s speed and longitudinal distance. The experiments and corresponding result analysis has shown that the oneM2M architectures are suitable to be used for such car-following application, which requires latencies below 100ms.},

	abstract = {Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) communication can help to prevent crashes between vehicles and pedestrians by extending the detection range of participants on collision course. This can be achieved by exploiting the inherent scanning and detecting features of the communication systems. However, there are several challenges to be solved if a communication-based approach is used to detect and actively prevent possible crashes. In this paper, we first discuss these challenges and then focus on communication aspects. More specifically, the focus is on the required reliability of the system that has to ensure the successful and timely delivery of crucial messages. Therefore, we evaluate the performance of V2P communication based on safety beaconing mechanisms in a typical intersection scenario in terms of delivery ratio and channel access. Both metrics describe the current networking situation and can have significant impact on the reliability of a crash prevention system. Our results show that the required beaconing intervals for early detection can add a significant load to the network and thus the delivery of crucial messages cannot be guaranteed with the default V2P setup due to increasing channel congestion. Finally, we discuss various options to limit the congestion.},

	abstract = {Global statistics show that about third of fatalities on the road involve pedestrians and cyclists, but surprisingly, this area is not receiving the attention it deserves from the research community. Communications between vehicles and smartphones held by pedestrians can greatly help in road accident prevention, and hence, introducing a system that exploits the advancements in wireless communication could certainly mitigate a significant part of the problem. Motivated by this, a system is proposed that relies on cellular communication and vehicle communication to detect probable vehicle to pedestrian crashes. Our simulations produced promising experimental results that illustrate the potentials of such a system in saving lives on the roads.},

	abstract = {The emergence of the Internet of Things has led to the evolution of conventional Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANETs) toward a new paradigm called the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). This latter has recently received the attention of many researchers. In order to overcome the different challenges, such as high mobility, the number of connected vehicles and the big data, clustering, as an important technique used in a VANET, has significantly improved the performance of numerous applications. In this regard, the present work proposes a new heuristic clustering algorithm based on RSU called HCAR for IoV, which entails the centralization of a clustering algorithm at distributed RSUs. This latter is responsible for performing the cluster formation phase based on a simple heuristic algorithm, using graph theory concepts, such as node degree and adjacency matrix. In addition, HCAR uses a new mechanism to recover the problem of the unavailability of cluster head (CH), through the election of a secondary CH using a weighted mechanism. Moreover, HCAR takes care of the maintenance phase to keep clusters’ stability and structure. The efficiency of the proposed scheme is proven theoretically, and the simulation results, in the NS-2 and VanetMobiSim integrated environment, show its performance advantages.},
